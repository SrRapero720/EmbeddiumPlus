# ⚠️ IMPORTANT | SOURCE DISCONTINUED ⚠️

> THE SOURCE CODE OF EMBEDDIUM++ HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.
> FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT [HERE](https://github.com/SrRapero720/EmbeddiumAdditions)

This mod is going to be **REWRITED FROM SCRATCH**. The purpose is the complete disconnection 
of any kind of relation to "upstream" (disconnection was already done in 1.2.0 but somehow people considers it "a fork")

Of course, the new version will be renamed to Embeddium++Additions and have more brand-new™ features.
adding more compat with other mods, more performance features, quality options, enhanced own made video settings screen and much more.

This new version has the mission of really give to Embeddium/Sodium additions who nobody asked but everybody wanted.

**AH, YES, ALSO WILL HAVE A FABRIC PORT FOR EMBEDDIUM FABRIC**

> If you have any of them or similar, you should remove them, may crash, collide or cause lag.
> 
> THIS MOD IS NOT COMPATIBLE AND NEVER WILL BE WITH XENON

# 🔰 VERSION 1.16.5

I decide to skip that version in favor of
[Embeddium Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium-extras) by PotatoBoy (aka TexTure).
It Is too good like Embeddium++, Shares features and has more Performance fixes and features.

# ⏩ THE FUTURE OF EMBEDDIUM++

Before I place some jokes, but this time I am 100% sure. 
All [Sodium Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium-extra) will be added
onto Embeddium++, making OBSOLETE some ports of it like Rubidium (Embeddium) Extra.

Create the first API around Sodium config page and include some misc optimization options like Cull Leaves
and quality features like Shadow Path Blocks

Enviddium (Nvidium port) will be a separated mod; I don't think it is a good idea to add it on embeddium++.
You can speed porting donating me, so I can afford a second-hand GTX 1660), you cannot, and anyway, I'll do it :)

Sodium++ will NOT exist...
